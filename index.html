            <p>Originally colonized by England in 1632, Antigua is a Caribbean island with a profoundly revelatory historical
                landscape that includes, along with the other islands of the region, a legacy of centuries of enslavement,
                oppression, exploitation, and murder of Africans and people of African descent. Many scholars of the Caribbean,
                have written about the plantation, specifically the sugar mill, as the primary symbol of the enterprise,
                of the machinery that created and sustained European colonization, empire, and economic prosperity for generations,
                while, at the same time, decimating black lives and bodies, contorted to support the production of sugar.
                The sugar mill factory was the technological implement of the Caribbean plantation and was the mechanism
                through which sugar, whose worth throughout the peak centuries of Caribbean sugar cane production, was equivalent
                to the value of crude oil today. In contemporary times, the Antiguan landscape is marked with the physical
                markers of the brutal and perfidious realities of the plantation in the form of the remnants of the windmills
                that were used for centuries to process sugarcane on the island.</p>

            <p>According to the 2013 report of the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda, there are more than 200 windmill bases extant
                on the island. The Museum of Antigua and Barbuda has been engaged in documenting the sugar mills of Antigua
                in conjunction with the especial work of independent scholar <a href='interview.pdf'> Agnes Meeker</a>. Her years of field work and research
                instigated the idea of using her work to digitize, map, and historicize each of the mills electronically
                for access to scholars and for lay people interested in studying Antiguan and Caribbean histories, as well
                as for tourists visiting the island—The Antigua Sugar Mills Project.</p>
