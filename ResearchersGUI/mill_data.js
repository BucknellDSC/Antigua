        "additional_info": "This mill was demolished when the Airport runway was lengthened, c. 1966 and there are no footprints left of this estate except for a burial ground belonging to the Nibbs family. \nAt the tip of Barnacle Point was Fort Byam which overlooked and protected Parham sound.  A map of Fort Byam surveyed by Kane William Horneck (1725) is located at John Carter Brown Library, which is at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and includes an inventory of supplies, a profile of the hill the fort is on and reports of hurricane damage.   There is also a lovely water colour sketch of the Fort with a flag flying, in the collection of prints and artwork once belonging to Ben Quinn of Parham Hill. \n\nThe Nibb's Family Burial Ground was also situated at Barnacle Point with records available up to 1808.  Dr. Reg Murphy was called in when three headstones were disturbed by the backhoe in 2007, one Nibbs family member and a Mr. Collins and his daughter.  They were replaced and buried while the gravestones were packed and sent up to Betty’s Hope where they will be added to a collection of MI’s disturbed island wide by the ubiquitous backhoe in the name of development.    “Again, it's the first time I've ever seen someone buried with their name right on the coffin and it is done in brass text and the copper and it's because of that it survived and the fabric around it and the wood is nailed into survived so there's Jeremiah Nibbs [phonetic] and the date he died, born and died, perfectly preserved [inaudible].”   Dr. Reg Murphy\n\n1832: William Nibbs buried at “Barnacle Point.”\nInformation on the graves can be found in Oliver Vol.II .\n\n1801: Charles Curtis was manager for Samuel Martin at High Point around 1801-1812.

A relative of Curtis, Janet Richards, recently came into possession of a box of correspondence between him and Samuel Martin including 41 pages of Accounts of the Bertie Entwhistle Trust for the above estates from 1812-1822.Interesting little bits of information can be gleaned from these accounts to give an idea of what was happening on the estate during this period.\nBertie Entwistle who was a senior member of H.M. Council,died at sea on board R.M.S. “Seine” on his way back to Antigua at the ageof 69. It was said that he was worth £35,000 at the time of his death.Two letter books kept in the Jarvis family papers at the  University of Michigan can provide further information.\n\nIn 1829 this estate contained 64 acres and shared slaves with another estate.\n\nLegacies of British Slave-ownership:   www.ukl.ac.uk.lbs/search/\nAntigua 357 Barnacle Point was awarded £908, 14 s 6 d for slaves not recorded.\nRalph Peters was the single awardee.\n1851: Antigua Almanac shows Barnacle Point of 64 acres belonging to Heirs of Bertie Entwistle.

Through his marriage to Lydia Byam (1837) he became one of the largest proprietors of land in Antigua at that time. He had also been very active in negotiating the terms of emancipation in England.\nThe 1852 census listed among their properties: 517 acre plantation at Martin’s Byam or Fitche’s Creek in St George’s Parish, MountLucye - 230 acre estate also in St. George’s, Cedar Valley - 128 acre plantation in St. John’s parish, Harts & Royals - two estates consisting of 206 acres, the 90 acre Blizard estate and diverse other estates owned or leased by Francis Shand.  \nThe union produced 13 children except for that of their heir Charles Arthur Shand.

Remains of a few old small stone buildings covered in wild coralita, can still be seen in the back of the village at the top of the hill.    As with most of the estates, the crest of the hill or high point was always built on in order to catch the breeze for the windmills and the cooling effect.

M569 The Beinecke Collection, Hamilton College.\n1871: A scene of the event is pictured in Christian Work, Nov. 1st 1871 – Mission Field.   “The Bishop of Antigua states that “Every estate in my parish has suffered badly and every chimney is thrown down.   On the day after the hurricane I buried eleven persons killed and on the next two days three who died from injuries sustained.   On Monday night, over 300 persons sat up together in the open air, exposed to incessant and drenching rains in St. Mark’s village, and the same scene was enacted in Barnes Hill distributed with my own hands every day 320 small loaves and 100 pieces of salt fish and sickness is now, alas beginning to abound.

It appeared in the British Medical Journal Oct 5th, 1889.   He was the Government Medical Officer at the time.   He came to the conclusion that it must depend upon “some very special kind of poison of rare occurrence taken in connection with food.”   He goes on to say, “The chief food of the negroes and lower orders here has been for generations past a salted fish called cod, but it might be anything else.   It is imported from the United States of America.   As health officer I can truly say that it does not always arrive or keep her perfectly sweet, nor did the effluvium from this food ever remind me very forcibly of the hay-fields of England.”\nIn 1890, Dr. John Freeland estimated there were then 53 lepers in Antigua, twelve men and 19 women who resided in the leper colony.  Dr. Freeland md. Miss Eleanor Foote October 30, 1819.\nAn interesting note is Freida Cassin’s “With Silent Tread” thought to be the earliest novel of Antigua and Barbuda in 1890.

This mill was destroyed to accommodate aircraft flying almost directly over the area on approach to Runway 10.   The community was also home to two of the three important lime kilns in the country.   The projects produced white lime used in construction and in controlling human waste.   White lime was also used for painting walls and for many years. To mark the creases for cricket matches and play boundaries in football.\nBarnes Hill also produced only the fourth steel band to be established in Antigua and Barbuda when Sun Valley was established in 1949 following Hell’s Gate, Brute Force and Red Army.   It was splinters from the feared “country band” that formed North Stars of New Winthorpes and Rising Sun of Pigotts – the likes of Manning and Vincent Freeland will attest to that fact.
