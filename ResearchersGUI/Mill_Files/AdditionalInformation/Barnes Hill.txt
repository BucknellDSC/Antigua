There is no longer a mill at this site and very little remains to identify this estate.   Old timers say that it was located at the extreme western end of Powell’s road and that it was destroyed when runway #10 was built to accommodate low flying aircraft. Remains of a few old small stone buildings covered in wild coralita, can still be seen in the back of the village at the top of the hill.    As with most of the estates, the crest of the hill or high point was always built on in order to catch the breeze for the windmills and the cooling effect.  It also allowed the planter to survey most of the estate. This now gives the village of Barnes Hill magnificent views towards the north of the island towards the sea.

1871: A scene of the event is pictured in Christian Work, Nov. 1st 1871 – Mission Field.   “The Bishop of Antigua states that “Every estate in my parish has suffered badly and every chimney is thrown down.   On the day after the hurricane I buried eleven persons killed and on the next two days three who died from injuries sustained.   On Monday night, over 300 persons sat up together in the open air, exposed to incessant and drenching rains in St. Mark’s village, and the same scene was enacted in Barnes Hill distributed with my own hands every day 320 small loaves and 100 pieces of salt fish and sickness is now, alas beginning to abound.   Barnes Hill School Chapel with brand new benches and lamps is utterly destroyed and blown to the winds   The whole village (700 inhabitants) is in complete ruins.”

Dr. John Freeland wrote “Notes on Leprosy as Observed in Antigua, West Indies.” Based on his experience working with lepers for over 30 years.  It appeared in the British Medical Journal Oct 5th, 1889.   He was the Government Medical Officer at the time.   He came to the conclusion that it must depend upon “some very special kind of poison of rare occurrence taken in connection with food.”   He goes on to say, “The chief food of the negroes and lower orders here has been for generations past a salted fish called cod, but it might be anything else.   It is imported from the United States of America.   As health officer I can truly say that it does not always arrive or keep her perfectly sweet, nor did the effluvium from this food ever remind me very forcibly of the hay-fields of England.”
In 1890, Dr. John Freeland estimated there were then 53 lepers in Antigua, twelve men and 19 women who resided in the leper colony.  Dr. Freeland md. Miss Eleanor Foote October 30, 1819.

Taken from the History of Barnes Hill.
The village, it is recorded, was named in honor of a young English settler, William Barnes, who was born in December 1656 and died in November 1695 who has the distinction of being the first known settler to be buried in a place of worship, the St. George’s Anglican Church, in Fitches Creek.
The Barnes Hill community had one of the earlier police stations and there was a solid sugar mill near the extreme western end of the Powell’s road.   This mill was destroyed to accommodate aircraft flying almost directly over the area on approach to Runway 10.   The community was also home to two of the three important lime kilns in the country.   The projects produced white lime used in construction and in controlling human waste.   White lime was also used for painting walls and for many years. To mark the creases for cricket matches and play boundaries in football.
Barnes Hill also produced only the fourth steel band to be established in Antigua and Barbuda when Sun Valley was established in 1949 following Hell’s Gate, Brute Force and Red Army.   It was splinters from the feared “country band” that formed North Stars of New Winthorpes and Rising Sun of Pigotts – the likes of Manning and Vincent Freeland will attest to that fact.   Two top players at one time were referred to as “Bum.”
“Bum” Jardine of Brute Force and Roy “Bum/Bumpers” Solomon of Barnes Hill.
