The mill still exists and there is no record that this estate converted to steam.  Nearby the mill is one of the low old stone out buildings still in use as a residence.  No sign exists of the old estate house and the whole hillside has been built up into a residential area.  Everyone has a clear and unobstructed view of the entire runway of the VC Bird International Airport, and before that it would have been Winthorpe’s village and earlier, Winthorpe’s estate.  The quote below ties in that this land was previously part of Winthorp’s estate sold to Major William Barnes who in turn sold it to Captain Francis Carlisle, an area known as Stokes land.
Carlisle Bay on the south side of the island near Old Road, St Mary’s,  is another reminder of the Carlisle family’s influence on the island in the early 1700’s.  A beautiful sand beach spans the bay, on which sits the Carlisle Bay Hotel.

When Major William Barnes of Millend, Stepney, died in 1694 his will was recorded in Antigua, part of which read.   “To my dear wife Mrs. Ursula Barnes, ½ of the yearly profits of my plantation in Antigua and 1/3 of the debt due to me from Captain Francis Carlisle of Antigua.”   A second will for his son, also William Barnes “of Antigua and sometimes London” leaves to his son, William Barnes £1200 at 21, and “the plantation I settled on my wife when I married her and 25 negroes.   See also Barnes Hill (#71).

1706: It is said when Colonel Parke, Governor of Antigua, lay dying and suffering the pangs of a ‘dismembered body’ that several members of the house of assembly stood around reviling and insulting him in his last agonies;  that among the numbers were Andrew Murray, Francis Carlisle, Mr. Tomlinson and Captain Painter which was hard to believe.
William Carlisle (d.1738) married Elizabeth, daughter of William McKinnon and upon his death left all his Personal Property and ready money to his widow, intending they should remain in the Family at her death.   However, “when nearly Seventy years and Paralytic”, she married a very young man John Gray of Scotland and at her death left everything in her power to him which amounted to between £25,000 and £30,000.   The Carlisle Estate, however stayed in the family.   The son of the first marriage, William Carlisle, died in Antigua around 1744 unmarried but settled his estate on his sister Alice who married Ralph Payne (1706-1762) of St. Kitts.  Their son, Ralph Payne (1739-1807) inherited Carlisle’s.

1800: Sir Ralph Payne, Lord Lavington, has an entry in the ODNB as ‘politician, which concludes “he died childless and almost destitute, and the legislature voted £300 per annum to his widow who died at Hampton Court Palace on 2 May 1830.   His career mirrored the rise and downfall of absentee sugar planters in Britain.”   He was a member of the British Parliament, he was invested with the ensigns to the Order of The Bath and at time of his death was a Senior Knight.   In 1771, he was appointed Captain-General and Governor of the Leeward Islands, in 1775  he was appointed Clerk of The Board of Green Cloth, in 1795 he was advanced to the Peerage of the Kingdom of Ireland, by the Title of Baron Lavington.   In 1801 His Lordship was again appointed Captain-General, Governor in Chief, and Vice Admiral of the Leeward Islands, and sworn a Member of the King’s Privy Council.   He died in 1807 at the age of 69 in Government House in Antigua whereupon, leaving no issue, the Barony became extinct.   His remains were interred in the garden of Carlisle’s Estate on a spot pointed out by himself for that purpose a short time before his death.   His admirable behavior in his duties left an indelible impression on the Inhabitants of Antigua.     West Indies

At the foot of the airport behind the cotton ginnery and galvanised factories is an estate grave with a wrought iron fence.   Sir George Walter.
The grave that everyone remembers and which figured so prominently on the landscape and which is no more belonged to Lord Lavington.   In 1939, Carlton and Ena Moore lived at Carlisle and the Lake children used to walk from Antigua Sugar Factory taking a shortcut through Pigott’s Village, to see them.   The great house was a short way passed the Army Base West gate.   The grave was in the middle of what used to be a canefield, just between the village and the road between the field and the Great House on the hill.   We always stopped off there.   It was surrounded by an iron work fence.   I guess Lord Lavington owned Carlisle’s as well as Lavingtons.   At that time Douglas Holmes A’court, Sr. was Manager at Lavingtons and we sometimes visited there also.   The only other thing I can remember about Lord Lavington apart from the location of the grave, is that his name was given to a local plant now known as Lord Lavington.   When villagers had a toothache, they would tie up their jaw with a mixture of crushed Lord Lavington leaves and lard.   Dentists were few and far between on the island at that time.

1950’s: Jack Vanier used to live in the old buff house.   One evening sitting on the veranda he felt the shackles rise on the back of his head and feeling of cold pervaded.   A feeling of malevolence persisted and he was certain someone was staring at him.   Upon turning he glimpsed a lady in white who would not move.   He finally got up and went towards her at which time she evaporated into thin air.   He was later told that the family buried their money and it was the custom to take a slave to dig the hole after which he was killed.   This time the slave killed the young lady and she continues to return to search for her money.”   Myrna Kelsick.
