There is still a mill on this site which is in good condition and was full of honey bees.  Old deserted mills are known to house bees and the honey is often collected by those in the know.   There is no evidence that this estate ever converted to steam.
Up until the late 1990’s the buff house still stood but was badly damaged by termites and crumbled in the last hurricane leaving the stone steps and lower story with some of the surrounding garden walls. To the east of the main house where the works might have been, was a building that had been repaired and was still in fairly good condition in 2000.  The whole area is now completely surrounded by bush.  Blackman’s is situated not far from Sir Vivian Richard’s Stadium which is to the south, and lies with its northernmost shores in Parham Harbour.   In the old days this was ideal for the shipping of sugar directly from the estate, instead of using the more laborious route overland by ox and cart.
Blackman’s is now owned by the Shoul family.
