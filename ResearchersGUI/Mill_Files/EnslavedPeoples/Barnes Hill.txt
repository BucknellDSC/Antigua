Based on contemporary research, we have little information to share about the enslaved peoples from this plantation at this time. We only know that the slave registry from 1813-1834 only lists “James Barrett, Fredericka Theresa, George Humphry, Lettice, John Prince, William Henry all between 1mth and 4 years old.” We will continue our quest for more information about these vital individuals.
