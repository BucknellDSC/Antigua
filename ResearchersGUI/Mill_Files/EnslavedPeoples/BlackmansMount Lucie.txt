Based on contemporary research, we have little information to share about the enslaved peoples from this plantation at this time. We only know that this estate contained 330 acres and 138 enslaved people in 1829, and it was awarded Â£2043 7 s 10 d for the freedoms of 130 of those people later that same year. We will continue our quest for more information about these vital individuals.
